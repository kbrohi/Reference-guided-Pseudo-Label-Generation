# Reference-guided-Pseudo-Label-Generation
Reference-guided Pseudo-Label Generation for Medical Semantic Segmentation

This repo contains implementation of the research called "Reference-guided Pseudo-Label Generation for Medical Semantic
Segmentation"

## Dataset
The dataset can be found [here](http://imgcom.jsrt.or.jp/minijsrtdb/)

## Notebook
The notebook has the comparison of the UNet and DeepLabV3 model for the JSRT dataset. Later, this solution will be used to create a pseudo labelling based solution for data labelling resulting in better accuracy.
